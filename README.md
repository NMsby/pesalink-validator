# PesaLink Bulk Account Validator

A system for validating bank accounts in bulk to prevent AC-01 errors before transaction processing.

## Overview

The PesaLink Bulk Account Validator is a solution for the PesaLink AI Fintech Hackathon challenge. It addresses the problem of invalid account errors (AC-01) in bulk payment processing by validating accounts before transactions are initiated.

The system accepts bulk files with account information, validates each account against the PesaLink API, and generates comprehensive reports identifying valid and invalid accounts with detailed error information.

## Features

- **Account Validation**: Validates account numbers against PesaLink's Account Validation API
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimizes validation through concurrent processing
- **Detailed Error Handling**: Provides clear reason codes for invalid accounts
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports of valid and invalid accounts
